# Basic MERN Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Since this is a MERN boilerplate it does expect a mongoDB connection url. See `.env.example` in `/config`.
environments are split up -> the environment for dev is `.env.development` and prod is `.env.production`.
```.env
PORT=8000
MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=
```
